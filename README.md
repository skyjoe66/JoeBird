# fugleramme
E-ink bird frame for Raspberry Pi - real-time bird detection by audio.

  <em>Sorry about the dirty window - squirrels have been stealing the bird food.</em>
</p>

> [!NOTE]
> Still in early development: expect the odd bug and a few unpolished edges, with plenty more features to come.

Built on top of [BirdNET-Go](https://github.com/tphakala/birdnet-go), which handles
the mic, the BirdNET classifier and the detection settings. Fugleramme reads
the detections and renders recently-seen birds on an [Inky-Impression](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-impression) e-ink panel.

> [!TIP]
> The e-ink panel is not required, although it's recommended for the intended experience. Without one, Fugleramme runs web-only - show the
> kiosk on a display over HDMI, or open it from any device on the network.

Live on **[fugleramme.arnegiacomo.dev](https://fugleramme.arnegiacomo.dev)** running from my kitchen window and displaying the actual birds currently heard in my garden (Bergen, Norway).

## This fork

[arnegiacomo/fugleramme](https://github.com/arnegiacomo/fugleramme) ships
artwork for Northern Europe, drawn one style at a time. This fork is for
everywhere else, and it changes two things:

- **One library, no picker, all of it generated.** Upstream's styles and
  hand-cut plates are gone; `assets/artwork/library/` holds only what the bot
  has drawn, so every bird on the glass matches every other. With one folder
  there is nothing to choose, and the admin's style row is left out.
- **Birds it cannot draw get drawn.** [`birdart/`](birdart/) watches
  BirdNET-Go, and for any species with no plate in the library it generates one
  in the style of a 19th-century natural-history engraving using **your own
  OpenAI API key**, cuts it out, checks it, and installs it. Synthetic images
  are marked as such in `manifest.json` and in
  [`library/ATTRIBUTION.md`](assets/artwork/library/ATTRIBUTION.md).

Everything below is upstream's README, unchanged.

## How it works

BirdNET-Go listens on a USB mic and records what it identifies. Fugleramme polls the BirdNET-Go api, matches each species to an illustration, then packs them onto a page, and redraws only when the birds change. There's an admin page that lets you configure what to show, and automatic updates and such.

If you already run BirdNET-Go, point the frame at it instead - on the same machine or anywhere else reachable from your network.

## Hardware

A Raspberry Pi 5, an [Inky Impression 13.3"](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-impression)
(Spectra 6), a USB mic and an A4 frame. Full parts list, alternatives, and why
each part: **[Hardware](docs/hardware.md)**.

## Art

The birds are cut-outs from historic, public-domain natural-history drawings,
hand-curated for this project. Each detected species is matched to its
illustration, background-removed, and packed onto a textured paper page - larger
birds toward the centre, sized by body mass. An empty window shows a bare perch.

Half the point of this project is showing off some amazing public-domain natural-history illustrations: every bird is cut from a real plate, no art is AI-generated (though some has been retouched with AI).

See [Adding artwork](docs/adding-artwork.md) for manual cutout steps.

## Known limitations

- **The artwork covers Northern Europe.** The plates are Scandinavian and
  British, so the Nordics, the British Isles and Germany are well covered. Elsewhere not so much (yet).
- **The mic matters more than the Pi.** Detection is BirdNET-Go's job, and how well it does depends mostly on the mic, where you put it, how many birds are in your area and so on.
- **BirdNET-Go OIDC not supported.** Currently only Basic Authentication (password) is supported. OIDC is in the works.

## Run locally (for development)

```bash
uv sync                                       # set up venv
uv run fugleramme-fake-detector               # stand-in BirdNET-Go on :8090
uv run fugleramme-dev                         # start service on :8080 with hot-reload
```

## Install on a Raspberry Pi

From the pi (assuming you have the hardware up and running):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnegiacomo/fugleramme/main/install.sh | bash
```

Asks where BirdNET-Go should live and which ports to use, clones the repo, installs the required deps, and starts the frame as a systemd service. **NB!** Will probably require a reboot on a fresh system.

If the display
stays blank after that, see
[Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md#panel-stays-blank).

From a blank SD card, see the full [install guide](docs/install.md).

## Prebuilt frames

I've built a few of these. If you'd like one rather than building it yourself,
please [get in touch](https://arnegiacomo.dev/).
